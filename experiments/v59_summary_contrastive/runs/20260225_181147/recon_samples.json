Situated within the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, its dorsal surface joins the triquetral, while its palmar surface attaches to ligaments and muscles. Unlike other carpal bones, it doesn't contribute to wrist movement. Its name originates from the Latin word for \"pea.\" Humans possess a shorter pisiform than apes, possibly due to evolutionary advantages like improved ulnar deviation and prevention of wrist hyperextension."
