    "reference": "Dendrology, also known as xylology, is the science and study of wooded plants like trees, shrubs, and lianas, specifically focusing on their taxonomic classifications. While related to botany, dendrology is a specialized subcategory studying only woody plants, unlike botany's broader scope. As part of industrial forestry, it emphasizes economically useful woody plants, while as an academic course, it covers all woody plants in a region. Noted dendrologists include Mike Baillie, Ludwig Beissner, and Francis A. Bartlett."
